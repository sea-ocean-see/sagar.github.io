                <h3>Boron Nitride Nanotube-Based Multifunctional Nanocarriers for Biomedical Application</h3>
                <p>This project was  recently completed in may of 2024 conducted over a year under our research advisor Dr.Santaneel Gosh project,we  successfully conducted research focusing on the creation of Boron Nitride Nanotubes (BNNTs) and their potential applications as multifunctional nanocarriers in biomedical fields. The project main fouces was on checking the different  properties of BNNT and its potential application in the field of biomedical . we used PC-12 cells, a model for neuronal cells, to investigate the biocompatibility and potential neuroprotective effects of BNNTs. Techniques such as fluorescence microscopy and cell viability assays were employed to assess the cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of BNNTs. The results indicated that BNNTs exhibited low toxicity and high potential for drug delivery and neuroprotection, paving the way for further exploration in targeted therapies and diagnostic applications.we are currently drafting the papaer for this research.</p>

                <p>During the NSF workshop for Nanobioengineering, I took on the role of instructor and mentor, guiding a group of 15 students through hands-on experiences in nanotechnology and cell culture techniques. I demonstrated and assisted students in synthesizing various types of nanoparticles, such as magnetic and polymer nanoparticles, using standard protocols. Additionally, I taught students how to subculture and maintain mammalian cell lines, ensuring sterile techniques and proper cell handling. I helped students design and execute experiments to test the interaction of synthesized nanoparticles with different cell lines. This experience successfully enhanced students' understanding of nanotechnology applications in biomedical research, fostering a collaborative and engaging learning environment.</p>

                <h3>Nanoscale Photo-Magnetic Energy Transfer Modulation to Restore the Homeostatic Functioning of the Damaged Endothelium</h3>
                <p>In my current NSF  research project under Dr.Santaneel Gosh, we are  focus on creating various types of nanoparticles and culturing and maintaining endothelial cells. My work involves designing and synthesizing nanostructures with magnetic properties to develop novel therapeutic platforms and .I am particularly interested in exploring the synergistic effects of optical and magnetic stimulation to restore the homeostatic functioning of damaged endothelium. This interdisciplinary approach combines advanced nanotechnology with regenerative medicine, aiming to improve treatment outcomes for cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. Through this project, I am contributing to the development of innovative, non-invasive therapies for endothelial damage.</p>

                <h3>Modular Enhanced Therapeutic Delivery System (METDS)</h3>
                <p>This is my  research project under Dr.Garret Casey which focuses on the design and development of a modular cell delivery system (MCDS) to enhance cancer treatment efficacy. We aim to create a targeted drug delivery system that can selectively deliver high concentrations of therapeutics to cancer cells while minimizing off-target toxicities. By employing receptor-mediated endocytosis and utilizing vitamin transporters as entry ligands, we achieve precise targeting and improved bioavailability. The modularity of our system allows for the integration of various therapeutic agents, diagnostics, and drug resistance modulators, expanding the therapeutic window and addressing drug resistance. Our first-generation MCDS includes different fluorophore-labeled constructs like Rohodoamine,coumarin and FITC to study uptake, optimize delivery concentrations, and assess cellular toxicity in various cancer cell lines. This approach aims to advance cancer treatment by increasing the potency and selectivity of chemotherapeutic agents. I have  successfully syntheis LA-K-FITC ,LA-A-Cou and LA-K-RhB , i am now working on reverse synthesis of this peptides , along with glutamine acid base delivary system and culturing cells to see the impact of these acid deivary system on primary cancer cells</p>
